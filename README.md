To make a copy of the project on your machine, use "git clone". After that, you can open the code directly in the folder by clicking on it in your default browser. Alternatively, you can install an extension called "Live Server" in your VSCode. Once you open the project in VSCode, you'll see a button in the lower right corner. Just click on "Live" and it will show you which template has been selected.
